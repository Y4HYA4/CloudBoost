# Core Fundamental Concepts
<img src="/images/CloudBoost.png"
     alt="Cb " />  
### Cloud Computing
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. These remote servers are owned by big technology companies called: the cloud provider (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform..)

### Microsoft Azure
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges providing more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines, to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

### Cloud Computing Advantages
There are several advantages that a cloud environment has over a physical environment that Tailwind Traders can use following its migration to Azure.

**High availability:** Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

**Scalability:** Apps in the cloud can scale vertically, and horizontally respectively: Increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine, Increase compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
    
**Elasticity:** You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.

**Agility:** Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

**Geo-distribution:** You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

**Disaster recovery:** By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

### CAPEX VS OPEX
There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:

**Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)** are major purchases a company makes to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets that are designed to be used over the long term. 
**Operating Expenditures (OPEX)** are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.

### Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
This **pay-as-you-go** model means usage is metered and you pay only for what you consume. The fundamental economics of cloud computing are based around the premise that customers will pay for how long a server is used, or how much bandwidth data is being consumed.
## Cloud Models
**Public Cloud** is cloud computing thatâ€™s delivered via the internet and shared across organizations. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, Azure in our case.

**Private Cloud** is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

**Hybrid Cloud** is any environment that uses both public and private clouds by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Cloud Service Models
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements.

     <br/>
      

 **1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  is also known as Hardware as a service. It is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it.

 **2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage the applications.This service provides the same benefits and considerations as IaaS, but there are some additional benefits to be aware of.

**3) Software as a service** is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.

      <br/>

###
### Serverless Computing  
Like PaaS, Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development.  

## Azure Architectural Components

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>


**Resources:** Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
**Resource groups:** Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
**Subscriptions:** A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
**Management groups:** These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

#### Azure Region
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.

#### Availability Zone
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

#### Azure Availability Zones
You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. When you host your infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires that you create duplicate hardware environments. Azure can help make your app highly available through availability zones.

#### Azure Region Pairs
Availability zones are created by using one or more datacenters. There's a minimum of three zones within a single region. It's possible that a large disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect even two datacenters. That's why Azure also creates region pairs.

### Interact with Microsoft Azure
**Azure Portal:** It is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface.

**Azure Resource Manager:** Another way to interact in a declarative way: Microsoft Infrastructure as a code tool, used only for Azure resources.

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>

### Virtual Machines

An Azure virtual machine is an on-demand, scalable computer resource that is available in Azure. Virtual machines are generally used to host applications when the customer requires more control over the computing environment than what is offered by other compute resources.   

### Virtual Machine Scale Sets 
they are built from virtual machines. With scale sets, the management and automation layers are provided to run and scale your applications. You could instead manually create and manage individual VMs, or integrate existing tools to build a similar level of automation

### Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances is a managed service that allows you to run containers directly on the Microsoft Azure public cloud, without requiring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
AKS allows you to quickly deploy a production ready Kubernetes cluster in Azure. It offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance.

### Azure App Service
Azure App Service lets you create apps faster with a one-of-a kind cloud service to quickly and easily create enterprise-ready web and mobile apps for any platform or device and deploy them on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure.

### Azure Functions 
Azure Functions is an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third party service as well as on-premises systems.

### Bonus, Azure Virtual Desktop
Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. It works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops and apps. You can also use most modern browsers to access Azure Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences

## Networking

      <br/>

 ### What is a Virtual Network ?
 A virtual network is a network where all devices, servers, virtual machines, and data centers that are connected are done so through software and wireless technology.

 ### Azure virtual networks 
 Enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. You can think of an Azure network as an extension of your on-premises network with resources that links other Azure resources.    

 ### Azure VPN Gateway 
 Azure VPN Gateway  is a cloud based network gateway that enables in connecting on-premises networks with Azure using site-to-site VPNs. Azure VPN Gateway provides secure connectivity by using industry standard protocols, IPsec and IKE to secure the connection. 

 ### Azure Express Route 
 It allows a private connection between the local network and the Microsoft cloud. Using express route organizations/users can connect to several Microsoft cloud services (cloud products e.g. Microsoft dynamics 365, Microsoft Azure and Office 365)

 **Note: We'll go deeper into the networking part meanwhile the AZ-104 examination.**
 ## Storage 
 ### What is an Azrue Storage Account ?
 An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects, including blobs, file shares, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>

### Azure Disk Storage
 Provides disks for Azure virtual machines. Applications and other services can access and use these disks as needed, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. Disk Storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.      

### Azure Blob Storage
Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

**Blob access tiers:**
- Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
- Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
- Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).

### Azure Files Storage
Azure Files is an Azure File Storage service you can use to create a file share in the cloud. It is based on the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and enables you to access files remotely or on-premises via API through encrypted communications.
 
### Azure Queue Storage 
 A service for storing large numbers of messages. You access messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account.

### Azure Table Storage 
 A service that stores non-relational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design.


## Database
