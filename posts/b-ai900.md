**Data and compute management:** Professional data scientists can leverage cloud-based data storage and compute resources to run data experiment code at scale.
**Pipelines:** Pipelines can be defined by data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals to orchestrate model training, deployment, and administration processes.

## Anomaly Detection
**What?** It is the capacity to detect mistakes or unexpected behaviour in a system automatically.

In data analysis, anomaly detection is generally understood to be the identification of rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behaviour.

**In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.**
## Computer Vision
**What?** It is the ability of software to use cameras, video, and photographs to interpret the world visually.  Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with visual processing. 

### Computer vision services in Microsoft Azure
To assist you in developing computer vision solutions, Microsoft Azure offers the following cognitive services:

**Computer Vision:** You can use this service to extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text from photos and videos.
**Custom Vision:** Using your own photographs, train custom image classification and object recognition models with this service.	
**Face:** You can use the Face service to create face detection and identification applications.
**Form Recognizer:** This service can be used to extract data from scanned forms and invoices.
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
**What?** It is the area of AI that deals with the ability of a computer to understand and respond to written or spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:
- Analyze and understand content from a variety of sources, including documents, emails, and other sources.
- Synthesize speech replies and interpret spoken language.
- Translate spoken or written sentences between languages automatically.
- Interpret commands and decide on the best course of action.

### Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

The AI capabilities of the solution enable it to index previously unsearchable texts as well as swiftly extract and reveal insights from enormous amounts of data.

## AI Risks
Artificial intelligence is a strong instrument that has the potential to assist the entire globe. It must, however, be used responsibly, just like any other too.

Some of the probable obstacles and hazards that an AI application developer can face:
### Fairness and Bias Concerns
 One perceived advantage of AI is that algorithms can make fair decisions, unencumbered by human bias. But an AI system’s decisions are only as good as the data it’s trained on. If a particular population is underrepresented in the data used to train a machine learning model, the model’s output could be unfairly discriminatory towards that population. 

### Accidents and Physical Safety Considerations
 If left unchecked, it’s possible for AI’s imperfections to cause physical harm. An innocent person is convicted of a crime based on evidence from facial recognition – who's responsible? 
Let’s look at self-driving cars, an AI application that is beginning to take hold in today’s automobile market. If a self-driving car malfunctions and goes off-course, that poses an immediate risk to the passenger, other drivers on the road, and pedestrians.

### Malicious Use of AI:
 AI researchers have managed to do a lot of good with the technology’s applications. But in the wrong hands, AI systems can be used for malicious or even dangerous purposes. In a 2018 report titled “The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation,” experts and researchers found that malicious use of AI technology could threaten our digital, physical, and political security.

## Responsible AI
**What?** It is the practice of designing, developing, and deploying AI with good intention to empower employees and businesses, and fairly impact customers and society—allowing companies to engender trust and scale AI with confidence.

At Microsoft, AI software development is guided by **six** principles aimed at ensuring that AI applications give great answers to complex challenges while avoiding unanticipated negative repercussions.

### Fairness
All persons should be treated equally by AI systems. Assume you're developing a machine learning model to support a bank's loan approval application. The model should forecast whether or not the loan should be authorized without taking into account any prejudice based on gender, race, or other variables that might provide specific groups of applicants an unfair benefit or disadvantage.
### Reliability And Safety
AI systems should be dependable and safe to use. Consider an AI-based software system for a self-driving car, or a machine learning model that detects patient symptoms and prescribes medications. Unreliability in these kind of systems can put people's lives at jeopardy.

### Privacy And Security
AI systems should be safe and secure, and they should respect people's privacy. Machine learning models, which underpin AI systems, rely on vast amounts of data, some of which may contain personal information that must be kept secret. Even after the models have been trained and the system has been put into operation, it continues to use new data to make predictions or perform actions that may raise privacy or security problems.
### Inclusiveness
Everyone should be empowered and engaged by AI technologies. Regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, race, or other factors, AI should benefit all members of society.

### Transparency
Artificial intelligence (AI) should empower and involve everyone. AI should help all members of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, color, or other variables.

### Accountability
AI systems should be held accountable. Designers and developers of AI-based solutions should adhere to a set of governance and organizational principles to ensure that the solution adheres to clearly defined ethical and legal norms.

# Machine Learning Tools
A lot of work goes into training and implementing an effective machine learning model, much of it time-consuming and resource-intensive. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based service that helps ease some of the procedures involved in preparing data, training a model, and deploying a predictive service by reducing the time it takes to do so. The remainder of this section will focus on Azure Machine Learning, including its automated machine learning capabilities.
## Automated Machine Learning
### Azure Machine Learning workspace
 You create a workspace in your Azure subscription when you use Azure Machine Learning. You may then utilize this workspace to manage your machine learning workloads' data, compute resources, code, models, and other artifacts.

### Compute Resource Types:
   **Compute Instances:** Data scientists can utilize these workstations to work with data and models.
   **Compute Clusters:** Scalable virtual machine clusters for on-demand experiment code processing. 
   **Inference Clusters:** Predictive service deployment targets based on your trained models.
   **Attached Compute:** Provides access to current Azure compute resources like Virtual Machines and Azure Databricks clusters. 
   ### A Dataset
   In Azure Machine Learning, data for model training and other operations is usually encapsulated in an object called a dataset.
   Datasets identify data within different data stores, such as tables, files, folders, and documents. For example, an Azure Blob dataset specifies the blob container and folder in Blob Storage from which the activity should read the data.
   
**Machine Learning Experiment:** In Azure Machine Learning, operations that you run are called experiments

**What is a pipeline?** 
A machine learning pipeline is the end-to-end construct that orchestrates the flow of data into, and output from, a machine learning model (or set of multiple models). It includes raw data input, features, outputs, the machine learning model and model parameters, and prediction outputs.
**What is inference pipeline?**
An inference pipeline in Azure Machine Learning uses the trained model to assign incoming input data to pre-defined labels. This serves as a template for a web service that you may publish and use by other services and apps.

#### Deployement
A service can be deployed as an Azure Container Instances (ACI) or an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in Azure Machine Learning. An AKS deployment is recommended for production applications, for which you must construct an inference cluster computing target. You'll utilize an ACI service in this exercise, which is a good deployment target for testing and doesn't require you to set up an inference cluster.
## Machine Learning Designer

### Regression Model
The supervised machine learning approach of regression is used to predict numeric values.

To use the Azure Machine Learning designer, you create a pipeline that you use to train a machine learning model. This pipeline starts with the dataset from which you want to train the model.
Following the creation and execution of a pipeline to train the model, you'll need a second pipeline that applies the same data transformations to new data and then utilizes the trained model to infer (or predict) label values based on its features. This will serve as the foundation for a predictive service that you can make available to applications.
### Classification Model
A supervised machine learning technique for predicting categories or classes is classification.
Classification is a type of machine learning that predicts which category (or class) an object belongs to. A health clinic, for example, might utilize a patient's attributes (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to determine whether the patient is diabetic. The attributes in this case are the patient's characteristics, and the label is a categorization of 0 or 1, indicating whether the patient is non-diabetic or diabetic.
### Clustering Model
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning in which related items are grouped together based on their characteristics. A researcher might, for example, gather measurements of penguins and group them together based on proportional similarities.
You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create clustering models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

# Computer Vision
Computer vision is a subfield of AI in which software systems are designed to perceive the world visually via cameras, images, and video. AI engineers and data scientists can solve a wide range of computer vision problems with a combination of custom machine learning models and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, including many cognitive services in Microsoft Azure.This section will go over some of what you can do with it.

You must build a resource for the Computer Vision service in your Azure subscription in order to use it. You have the option of using one of the following resource types:

  **Computer Vision:** A dedicated resource for the service's Computer Vision. If you don't plan to use any other cognitive services, or if you wish to track consumption and expenditures for your Computer Vision resource independently, choose this resource category.
 **Cognitive Services:** A repository for generic cognitive services that covers Computer Vision as well as a variety of other cognitive services including Text Analytics, Translator Text, and others. If you want to use many cognitive services and want to make administration and development easier, this resource category is for you.
  
Regardless of the sort of resource you create, it will provide two bits of information that you will need to use it:
- A secret key that is used to verify the authenticity of client apps.
- The HTTP address at which your resource can be accessed is provided by this endpoint.

## Analyze Images
identifying loads of things in a photo and evaluating it:

 **Describing an image:** Computer Vision can examine a picture, evaluate the objects discovered, and output a human-readable phrase or sentence that describes what was found in the image.
 
 **Tagging visual features:** Computer Vision's picture descriptions are based on a database of thousands of identifiable items that can be used to suggest tags for the image.
 
 **Detecting objects:** The service feature is similar to tagging in that it can identify common things; however, instead of just tagging or providing tags for the detected objects, this service can also supply bounding box coordinates.
   **Bonus:** A bounding box (usually shortened to bbox) is an area defined by two longitudes and two latitudes, where: Latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0. Longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0

 **Detecting brands:** This function allows you to recognize commercial brands. Thousands of widely recognizable logos from commercial brands of products are already in the service's database.
  
 **Detecting faces:** The Computer Vision service can detect and analyze human faces in images, including determining age and generating a bounding box rectangle for the face's location (s).
  
 **Categorizing an image:** Computer Vision can classify images based on what they contain. With a "current" limited set of categories, the service uses a parent/child hierarchy.

 **Detecting domain-specific content:** 
   - Celebrities: The service includes a model that has been trained to identify thousands of well-known celebrities from the worlds of sports, entertainment, and business.
  - Landmarks  The service can identify famous landmarks, such as the Taj Mahal and the Statue of Liberty.
  
   **Optical character recognition:** The Computer Vision service can detect printed and handwritten text in photos using optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities.





## Classify Images
### Classification
 is a supervised form of learning, where you teach the computer to do something with data that's already labeled by humans. This training set includes a fixed amount of labels or categories for the computer to learn from.

### Image classification
 is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules. The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. Two general methods of classification are 'supervised' and 'unsupervised

### Custom Vision Service

**What is Neural Network:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. CNNs apply to image processing, natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks.


The majority of recent image classification solutions rely on deep learning approaches that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to find patterns in pixels that correlate to different classes. Training an effective CNN is a difficult process that necessitates a high level of data science and machine learning knowledge.

The Custom Vision cognitive service in Microsoft Azure has integrated common methodologies for training image classification models, making it simple to train a model and publish it as a software service with little knowledge of deep learning techniques. You can train image classification models with the Custom Vision cognitive service and then deploy them as services for apps to use.

## Read Text
The Computer Vision service, which also has image analysis skills, is in charge of extracting text from images.

A lot of the time, an image has words in it. It might be typed or handwritten text. Images of road signs, scanned documents in image formats such as JPEG or PNG file formats, or even just a photograph of a white board used during a conference are all popular examples.

The OCR API and the Read API are two application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the Computer Vision service for reading text in images.

#### OCR API
 An Optical Character Recognition(OCR) API helps you transcribe text from image files and PDF documents and receive the extracted data in a JSON/CSV/Excel or other file formats. 
#### The Read API
 The Read API uses an updated recognition model, takes an image or PDF document as the input and extracts text asynchronously.

## Detect objects in images
 **Using  the Custom Vision service**
### Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. The main purpose of object detection is to identify and locate one or more effective targets from still image or video data

#### Returned Information:
- Each object in the image is assigned a class.
- The object classification's likelihood score.
- For each object, the coordinates of a bounding box.


## Detect And analyz faces

Face detection and analysis is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) in which algorithms are used to find and evaluate human faces in photos and videos.

**Using the Face service**

### Face detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.
### Facial analysis
An intersection between computer vision, Machine Learning and Image processing fields that aims to extract any kind of information from human face except his/her identity such as emotion, engagement, vitals measurement, demographics information age and gender to name a few
### Facial recognition
Simply, to train a machine learning model to recognize known persons based on their facial traits.
 It entails training a model with many photos of each person you want to recognize so that it can recognise those individuals in new images that it hasn't been trained on.



## Analyze Receipts
### Using  the Form Recognizer service
Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI Service that uses machine-learning models to extract key-value pairs, text, and tables from your documents.

You may use Azure's Form Recognizer to automate the processing of data in documents like forms, invoices, and receipts. It blends cutting-edge optical character recognition (OCR) with prediction algorithms that can decipher form data in the following ways:

- Field names and values are matched.
- Tables of data processing
- Identifying certain field kinds, such as dates, phone  numbers, addresses, totals, and so on.

You must either build a Form Recognizer resource or a Cognitive Services resource in your Azure subscription to use the Form Recognizer. The Form Recognizer service is accessible through both resource types.

After the resource has been built, you can construct client applications that link submit forms for analysis using the resource's key and endpoint.

#### Pre-built receipt model
- Time of transaction
- Date of transaction
- Merchant information
- Taxes paid
- Receipt totals
- Other pertinent information that may be present on the receipt
- All text on the receipt is recognized and returned as  well
