# Core Data Concepts
## Data Formats
<img src="/images/DP900STUFF/dataformat.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>

### Structured Data 
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content.
The schema for structured data entities is tabular - in other words, the data is represented in one or more tables that consist of rows to represent each instance of a data entity, and columns to represent attributes of the entity. This data type is generally stored in a relational database.
### Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not obey the tabular structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data.
Common format for semi-structured data is JSON & XML.
```
// Customer 1
{
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Jones",
  "address":
  {
    "streetAddress": "1 Main St.",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10099"
  },
  "contact":
  [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 123-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "joe@litware.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy like, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well.
Some examples of unstructured data: Email, Text Files, Media..
### Data stores
A data store is a repository for persistently storing and managing collections of data which include not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types such as simple files.
There are two broad categories of data store in common use:
**File stores** and **Databases**. 

## File Formats 
### Delimited text files
A delimited text file is a text file used to store data, in which each line represents a single book, company, or other thing, and each line has fields separated by the delimiter.

```
First_Name,Last_Name,CardNum,EmpNo,HireDate,Salary,Bonus_2011
Lila,Remlawi,8590122497663807,000008,12/28/2007,52750,"$1,405.40"
Vladimir,Alexov,8590122281964011,000060,10/5/2007,41250,"$4,557.43"
Alex,Williams,8590124253621744,000104,8/12/2010,40175,"$7,460.02"

```
### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays. 
```
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "variables": {
    "container1name": "aci-tutorial-app",
    "container1image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest",
    "container2name": "aci-tutorial-sidecar",
    "container2image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-tutorial-sidecar"
  },
```
### Extensible Markup Language (XML)
Extensible Markup Language, looking close to HTML syntax, is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data can be used in mobile developement. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <  LinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:orientation="horizontal">
```
### Binary Large Object (BLOB)
A binary large object is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob.
```
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
        GdaConnection *cnc;
        const gchar *filename = NULL;
        gint id = 0;
        gboolean store;
        GError *error = NULL;
        gboolean result;

        /* parse arguments */
        if (argc != 3)
        {
                goto help;
        }
        if (! g_ascii_strcasecmp (argv[1], "store"))
        {
                filename = argv[2];
                store = TRUE;
        }
        else if (! g_ascii_strcasecmp (argv[1], "fetch"))
        {
                id = atoi (argv[2]);
                store = FALSE;
        }
        else
        {
                goto help;
        }
}
```
### Optimized file formats
- **Avro** It was created by Apache. Each record contains a header that describes the structure of the data in the record. This header is stored as JSON. The data is stored as binary information.
- **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar format):** Organizes data into columns rather than rows. It was developed by HortonWorks for optimizing read and write operations in Apache Hive (Hive is a data warehouse system that supports fast data summarization and querying over large datasets).
- **Parquet:** A columnar data format. It was created by Cloudera and Twitter. A Parquet file contains row groups. Data for each column is stored together in the same row group. Each row group contains one or more chunks of data. A Parquet file includes metadata that describes the set of rows found in each chunk.

## Databases
<img src="/images/DP900STUFF/DB.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>
A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.
### Relational databases
A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data. Relational databases are commonly used to store and query structured data.
A system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system.
### Non-relational databases
Non-relational databases are data management systems that don’t apply a relational schema to the data. Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL database, even though some support a variant of the SQL language.
Exemple: Key-value databases, Document databases, Column family databases & Graph databases.

## Transactional Data Processing
Think of a transaction as a small, discrete, unit of work. This last performed by transactional systems is often referred to as Online Transactional Processing.
OLTP solutions rely on a database system in which data storage is optimized for both read and write operations in order to support transactional workloads in which data records are created, retrieved, updated, and deleted (often referred to as CRUD operations). These operations are applied transactionally, in a way that ensures the integrity of the data stored in the database.
OLTP systems are typically used to support live applications that process business data - often referred to as line of business (LOB) applications.
## Analytical Data Processing
**Data analysis** is the process of cleaning, changing, and processing raw data, and extracting actionable, relevant information that helps businesses make informed decisions.

Analytical data processing typically uses read-only (or read-mostly) systems that store vast volumes of historical data or business metrics. Analytics can be based on a snapshot of the data at a given point in time, or a series of snapshots.
**A data lake** is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. This is common in modern data analytical processing scenarios, where a large volume of file-based data must be collected and analyzed.
**Data Warehouse** In computing, also known as an enterprise data warehouse, is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence. It is an established way to store data in a relational schema that is optimized for read operations – primarily queries to support reporting and data visualization. 

# Data Job Roles
<img src="/images/DP900STUFF/roles.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>
**The three key job roles that deal with data in most organizations are:**

## Database administrators
 Manage databases, assigning permissions to users, use specialized software to store and organize data. The role may include capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, as well as backup and data recovery.
## Data engineers
 Manage infrastructure and processes for data integration across the organization, applying data cleaning routines, identifying data governance rules, and implementing pipelines to transfer and transform data between systems.
 They are responsible for designing and implementing digital databases. They use computing tools to create new databases or adjust the function and capacity of existing databases.
## Data analysts 
Explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts that enable organizations to make informed decisions.
A database analyst deals with database technologies that warehouse information in very specific ways. A database analyst is part of conventional corporate IT teams that maintain data assets through very specific research and activities. A database analyst is also known as a data modeler.



# Data Services
<img src="/images/DP900STUFF/services.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>
Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform that powers the applications and IT infrastructure for some of the world's largest organizations. It includes **many services** to support cloud solutions, including transactional and analytical data workloads.

## Azure SQL
**What's SQL?** SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
**Azure SQL** is the collective name for a family of relational database solutions based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. 

Specific Azure SQL services include:
- **Azure SQL Database:** A fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database hosted in Azure
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance:** A hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner.
- **Azure SQL VM:** A virtual machine with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility.

# Relational data
## Relational Data Concepts

### Understand normalization
Normalization is a term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity.
Database normalization is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).

### SQL dive
SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and is used to communicate with a relational database. It's the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data in a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.

SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP can be used to accomplish practically any task with a database. Despite the fact that these SQL statements are part of the SQL standard, many database management systems have their own proprietary extensions to handle the system's characteristics. These extensions add functionality to SQL that isn't covered by the standard, such as security management and programmability.

SQL statements are grouped into three main logical groups:

**Data Definition Language (DDL):** You use DDL statements to create, modify, and remove tables and other objects in a database (table, stored procedures, views, and so on).
``` SQL
CREATE TABLE Product
(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL NULL
);
```

**Data Control Language (DCL):** Database administrators generally use DCL statements to manage access to objects in a database by granting, denying, or revoking permissions to specific users or groups.
``` SQL
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
ON Product
TO user1;
```
**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** You use DML statements to manipulate the rows in tables. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE City = 'Seattle';
``` 
``` SQL
INSERT INTO Product(ID, Name, Price)
VALUES (99, 'Drill', 4.99);
``` 

### Database Objects
#### Database View
A database view is a subset of a database and is based on a query that runs on one or more database tables. Database views are saved in the database as named queries and can be used to save frequently used, complex queries. There are two types of database views: dynamic views and static views.
``` SQL
CREATE VIEW Deliveries
AS
SELECT o.OrderNo, o.OrderDate,
       c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Address, c.City
FROM Order AS o JOIN Customer AS c
ON o.CustomerID = c.ID;
``` 
#### Stored Procedure
A stored procedure is a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with an assigned name, which are stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) as a group, so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.
``` SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE RenameProduct
	@ProductID INT,
	@NewName VARCHAR(20)
AS
UPDATE Product
SET Name = @NewName
WHERE ID = @ProductID;
``` 

#### Index
An index helps you search for data in a table. Think of an index over a table like an index at the back of a book. A book index contains a sorted set of references, with the pages on which each reference occurs. When you want to find a reference to an item in the book, you look it up through the index. You can use the page numbers in the index to go directly to the correct pages in the book. Without an index, you might have to read through the entire book to find the references you're looking for.
``` SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_ProductName
ON Product(Name);
``` 

## Relational Database Services 

### Azure SQL services

#### 	SQL Server on Azure VMs (IaaS)
SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine effectively replicates the database running on real on-premises hardware. Migrating from the system running on-premises to an Azure virtual machine is no different than moving the databases from one on-premises server to another.

Use this option when you need to migrate or extend an on-premises SQL Server solution and retain full control over all aspects of server and database configuration.
#### Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)
Azure SQL Managed instance effectively runs a fully controllable instance of SQL Server in the cloud. You can install multiple databases on the same instance. You have complete control over this instance, much as you would for an on-premises server. SQL Managed Instance automates backups, software patching, database monitoring, and other general tasks, but you have full control over security and resource allocation for your databases.

Use this option for most cloud migration scenarios, particularly when you need minimal changes to existing applications.
#### Azure SQL Database (	PaaS)
Azure SQL Database is a PaaS offering from Microsoft. You create a managed database server in the cloud, and then deploy your databases on this server. Azure SQL Database is available as a Single Database or an Elastic Pool.
**Single Database:** This option enables you to quickly set up and run a single SQL Server database. You create and run a database server in the cloud, and you access your database through this server.
**Elastic Pool:** This option is similar to Single Database, except that by default multiple databases can share the same resources, such as memory, data storage space, and processing power through multiple-tenancy.

Use this option for new cloud solutions, or to migrate applications that have minimal instance-level dependencies.

### Open-Source Databases
MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL are relational database management systems that are tailored for different specializations.

#### MySQL
 It started life as a simple-to-use open-source database management system. It's the leading open source relational database for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack apps. It's available in several editions; Community, Standard, and Enterprise. The Community edition is available free-of-charge, and has historically been popular as a database management system for web applications, running under Linux. Versions are also available for Windows. Standard edition offers higher performance, and uses a different technology for storing data. Enterprise edition provides a comprehensive set of tools and features, including enhanced security, availability, and scalability. The Standard and Enterprise editions are the versions most frequently used by commercial organizations, although these versions of the software aren't free.
**Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server:** MySQL in Azure Database Flexible Server is a fully managed database as a service with predictable performance and scalability. Database management functions and configuration settings are more granularly controlled and flexible with Flexible Server. All new developments or migrations should use the flexible server deployment option.
**Azure Database for MySQL Single Server:** MySQL in Azure Database Single Server is a fully managed database as a service with predictable performance and scalability. Single servers are ideal for applications that are already running on a single server.

#### MariaDB
It is a newer database management system, created by the original developers of MySQL. The database engine has since been rewritten and optimized to improve performance. MariaDB offers compatibility with Oracle Database (another popular commercial database management system). One notable feature of MariaDB is its built-in support for temporal data. A table can hold several versions of data, enabling an application to query the data as it appeared at some point in the past.

#### PostgreSQL 
It is a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties. The database management system is extensible; you can add code modules to the database, which can be run by queries. Another key feature is the ability to store and manipulate geometric data, such as lines, circles, and polygons.

PostgreSQL has its own query language called pgsql. This language is a variant of the standard relational query language, SQL, with features that enable you to write stored procedures that run inside the database.

**Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server:** The single-server deployment option for PostgreSQL provides similar benefits as Azure Database for MySQL. You choose from three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier supports different numbers of CPUs, memory, and storage sizes; you select one based on the load you expect to support.
**Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server:** The flexible-server deployment option for PostgreSQL is a fully managed database service. It provides more control and server configuration customizations, and has better cost optimization controls.
**Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus):** Hyperscale (Citus) is a deployment option that scales queries across multiple server nodes to support large database loads. Your database is split across nodes.
