### Power Apps
Power Apps are a great tool for anyone to learn and contribute quickly, regardless of their educational background or previous experience.
With Power Apps quickly build apps for mobile and web, from low-code to no-code. It also provides a way for non-developers to become familiar with the app creation process and create their own apps. Developers can also efficiently and productively conceive and build more complex solutions. Power Apps can connect to existing data from SharePoint, Excel, SQL, Common Data Service, and many other data sources. In addition, you can use these data sources to organize the various components of your Power App and create intuitive functionality.
### Power Automate
Power Automate is a cloud-based automation platform that allows users to build automated processes across different apps and services.
Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow) is a web-based tool designed to interface with a growing library of software from both Microsoft and other vendors.
With Power Automate, you can simplify your life and reduce the number of manual tasks you perform. Using Power automate you can manage the cloud data and te onpremises data.
### Power BI 
PowerBI is a business intelligence platform which enables business users to gather and display their data in easily interpretable charts and graphs. 
Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on premises hybrid data warehouses
### Power Virtual Agents
Power Virtual Agents is a tool to build powerful chatbots without the need to write code, and that allows you to automate communication with potential clients or employees. The goal is to easily create and maintain virtual agents without programming, using a guided graphical interface without the need for data analysts or developers.

### Connectors
#### Data Source types:
- Tabular data source: It is one that returns data in a structured table format.
- Function-based data: A function-based data source is one that uses functions to interact with the data source.

**Connectors** are the bridges from your data source to your app, workflow, or dashboard. Microsoft Power Platform has more than 600 connectors available to common data sources.
Examples of popular connectors include Salesforce, Office 365, Twitter, Dropbox, Google services, and more.
### Microsoft Dataverse
A Dataverse is essentially an online database or data warehouse that pulls in and stores data from multiple sources. This data can then be accessed or pushed into other applications for analysis and further use. Microsoft Dataverse is the common currency that enables the components of Microsoft Power Platform to work together. It is the foundation that enables the consolidation, display, and manipulation of data.
### AI Builder
Microsoft AI Builder is a Power Platform capability to speed up processes, predict outcomes and improve performance through AI insights. 
With AI Builder, you do not need coding or data science skills to access the power of AI. You can build custom models tailored to your needs, or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios.
